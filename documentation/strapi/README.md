# Strapi initialization
Files and documents that can be useful when initializing a fresh instance of Strapi (and MongoDB)
- `mongo-init_{groups,journeys,places,tags}.archive` are bson-formatted archives of collections that are exported by `mongodump`
- `mongo-init_{groups,journeys,places,tags}.json` are plain text of the same collections
- PDFs include information how certain settings in Strapi should look like
  - internationalization, and
  - user permissions & roles
